# WebSite-Designing
These Are the some Of the Websites Which I made With the HTML, CSS &amp; JS.

The Change Is You Want To download all the files and then you should put css file into css folder(Remember You Want to make this folder if it is not there), JS File in JS Folder. Then You will get the output with my website.
